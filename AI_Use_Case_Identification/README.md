# AI Use-Case Identification & Business Impact Analysis

## Objective
To identify high-impact and feasible Artificial Intelligence (AI) use cases across key business functions and evaluate their business value, risks, and readiness for implementation.

This project demonstrates how an AI Business Analyst approaches AI adoption from a **business-first, responsible, and outcome-driven perspective**.

---

## Business Problem
Organizations often adopt AI tools without a clear understanding of where AI can deliver real value. This leads to inefficient implementation, low ROI, and potential ethical risks.

The goal of this project is to apply a structured framework to:
- Identify suitable AI use cases
- Assess feasibility and impact
- Ensure responsible and ethical AI usage

---

## Scope of Analysis
The analysis focuses on the following business functions:
- Marketing
- Sales
- Operations

## AI Use Cases Identified

| Business Function | Business Problem | AI Use Case | Expected Benefit |
|------------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| Marketing | Manual content planning and analysis | AI-assisted content recommendations | Faster campaign creation and improved engagement |
| Sales | Inefficient lead prioritization | AI-based lead scoring | Higher conversion rates |
| Operations | Manual reporting and delayed insights | AI-assisted business reporting | Faster decision-making |

---

## Feasibility & Impact Assessment

Each use case was evaluated using the following criteria:

| Criteria | Evaluation |
|--------|-----------|
| Data Availability | Medium |
| Business Impact | High |
| Implementation Complexity | Low |
| Operational Risk | Low–Medium |

**Summary:**  
The identified use cases offer strong business value with manageable implementation effort, making them suitable for early-stage AI adoption.

## Responsible AI Considerations
The following principles were applied throughout the analysis:
- Protection of data privacy and security
- Awareness of bias in AI-generated outputs
- Human oversight in decision-making
- Transparency and explainability of AI recommendations

AI is positioned as **decision support**, not decision replacement.

## Success Metrics & ROI Indicators
The effectiveness of AI implementation can be measured using:
- Reduction in manual effort (%)
