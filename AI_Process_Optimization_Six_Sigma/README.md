# AI-Enabled Process Optimization using Six Sigma

## Objective
To demonstrate how AI can be applied within a Six Sigma DMAIC framework to optimize business processes and improve operational efficiency.

## Business Problem
Manual business reporting processes are time-consuming and delay decision-making. This project analyzes inefficiencies and proposes AI-enabled improvements.

## Methodology
Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)

## Work Performed
- Analyzed an existing business reporting process
- Identified inefficiencies and root causes
- Proposed AI-assisted improvements using generative AI
- Defined control mechanisms and success metrics

## Outcome
Presented a structured AI-driven process optimization approach suitable for analytics and business teams.
